**This mod aims to add food to the [Cobblemon Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon), meaning some features won't be implemented until sometimes.**

---

**This is a Fabric port of the original Forge [PokeFood Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/pokefood).**
~~Also fabric isn't supported for now and may never be.~~

---

**Almost all the food can be crafted either on a crafting table, or the mod's custom crafting systems, It's highly recommended to use [JEI](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) (for normal recipes) and [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) (you'll be able to craft some books that explains most of what can be made in PokeFood (food-wise only for now).**

**This mod will never be back-ported !**

**It is highly recommended to keep the mod up to date as much as possible as it either implements new bug fixes or adds new content, if you are interested with my naming process it is as follow:**

---

- X.... the first number is **the main version**, it change only when a specific goal is reached (ex 0.9 to 1.0 when all that was planned was fully added);
- ..X.. the second number is the **importance version**, it changes only when a great amount of changes happens (ex:1.0 to 1.1);
- ....X the letter, it indicate the **hot-fix / bug-fix or added content that fix problems** or isn't big enough to be kept for a new update.
